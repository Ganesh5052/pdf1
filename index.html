     <p><i>Data mining is increasingly being used to gain competitive advantage. In this chapter,
we propose a principle of maximum performance efficiency (MPE) as a contribution to
the data-mining toolkit. This principle seeks to estimate optimal or boundary behavior,
in contrast to techniques like regression analysis that predict average behavior. This
MPE principle is explained in the context of activity-based costing situation.
Specifically, we consider the activity-based costing situation in which multiple
activities generate a common cost pool. Individual cost drivers are assigned to the
respective activities, but allocation of the cost pool to the individual activities is
regarded as impractical or expensive. Our study focuses on published data from a set

    <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 30px;"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h2>
    <div class="content-container" style="font-size: 20px;">
     <dd>In recent years, companies have started to realize the potential of using data-mining</dd>
        <p style="margin-top: 1px;">techniques as a form of competitive advantage. For example, in the finance industry, in
the decade from 1980 to 1990, the number of credit cards issued doubled to about 260
million. But, in the next ten years, there was not another doubling of this number. Given
that there are now about 280 million people in the United States, it is widely believed that
the credit card market is saturated (Berson, Smith, & Thearling, 2000). In such situations,
any gains by one company leads to a loss for another — a zero-sum game. To gain
competitive advantage, credit card companies are now resorting to data-mining tech-niques to retain and identify good customers at minimal cost.</p><dd>The cell phone industry is also expected to go the way of the credit card market.</dd>
        <p style="margin-top: 1px;">Soon, the cellular industry will be saturated; everybody who needs cells phone will have
one. Companies who are able to predict and understand customer needs better, will
probably be the ones who will survive. The cellular industry, like the credit card industry,
is likewise resorting to data-mining techniques to identify traits for retaining good
customers.</p>
       <dd>Research in data mining has so far focused on either developing new techniques</dd>
        <p style="margin-top: 1px;">or on identifying applications. Being a multidisciplinary field, data-mining techniques
have originated from areas of artificial intelligence, database theory, visualization,
mathematics, operations research, and statistics, among others. Many of the well-known
statistical techniques like nearest neighbor, clustering, and regression analysis are now
part of the data-mining toolkit.</p>
        <dd>In this chapter, we present a new technique based on the principal of maximum</dd>
        <p style="margin-top: 1px;">performance efficiency (MPE). While techniques like linear regression analysis are used
to predict average behavior, MPE seeks to predict boundary or optimal behavior. In many
cases, such models are actually more desirable. For example, in a saturated credit card
or cellular phone market, a company may seek to predict characteristics of its best
customers. In essence, choosing to concentrate on customers who are low risk/cost to
maximize profit. Such models, usually called ceiling/floor models, can also be used as part
of data-mining techniques for benchmarking. For example, a company may be interested
in comparing the quality of its products over different product lines. The MPE criterion
seeks to identify the characteristics of the best performing unit, thus allowing the
company to implement these measures in other units to improve their quality, and hence
the competitive advantage of the company across product lines.</p><dd>We propose the MPE principle and show how it can be used to estimate the best</dd><p style="margin-top: 1px;">practice costs in an activity-based costing situation. The rest of the chapter is organized

    <div class="content-container" style="font-size: 20px;">
    <p>as follows. In the next section, we present our initial motivation for developing the MPE
principle. As an example, we consider an activity-based costing situation where multiple
activities generate a common cost pool. Our objective is to estimate the best practice cost
rates. The following section then distinguishes between basic cost models and the
models used to estimate the parameters of the basic cost models. The maximum performance efficiency (MPE) principle is developed using an aggregate efficiency measure
that is the sum or average of performance efficiencies. Then the MPE principle is used
to derive the linear programming estimation model. The next section describes the data
for the study. The MPE criterion is applied to this data, and the results are compared with
a previous analysis to assess face validity for the proposed new method. The following
section proposes a model aptness theory based on the gamma distribution and a
technique called vertical density representation. The fitted performance efficiency
scores are required to satisfy a benchmark for validity of the goal assumption called
normal-like-or-better performance effectiveness. This is followed by limitations and
some extensions to other basic cost models. The next section discusses potential datamining applications and considerations, and is followed by the Conclusions section</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 30px;"><b>MOTIVATION</b></h2>
        
        <p><dd>Managerial accountants are often called upon to provide measures of performance efficiency.Such a task is essentially in singal</dd>Such a task is essentially trivial if there is a single input measure and a single output measure. One could simply divide the output measure by the input measure and use the resulting performance efficiency measure to either: (1) compare the unit’s performance over time, or (2) compare the unit’s performance with other comparable
units.
<dd>While there are numerous purposes for performance efficiency measures (i.e.,
performance evaluation,</dd> managerial compensation, benchmarking, and cost control, to
name a few), the specific purpose of this research is to explain and illustrate how a
proposed estimation principle can be used with activity-based costing for determining
performance efficiency measures for the purpose of cost control. Activity-based costing
is one approach that could be used to develop a performance measure for such purposes.
Activity-based costing consists of disaggregating costs into specific cost pools that can
be linked causally with their respective activities. Cooper and Kaplan (1992) illustrate
how such an approach can be used with purchase order data. The approach consists of
dividing the monthly cost of processing purchase orders by the number of purchase
orders processed per month. This purchase order cost can then be used as a benchmark
for comparison purposes. This approach is very simple and easy to use if there is only
one cost pool and one activity with a single cost driver. But there are many realistic
scenarios in which there are multiple cost drivers for a single cost pool. For example,
faculty salaries for an academic unit (department or college) appear to be driven by at least
two cost drivers. Both student credit hours generated and the level of academic degrees
</p>

        <p><dd>offered (bachelor’s, master’s, and doctorate) appears to drive the amount of faculty.The dilemma is that faculty</dd>
salaries for an academic unit. The dilemma is that faculty salaries are in a single cost pool,
and there is no simple and objective method for disaggregating faculty salaries. The task
of attributing the faculty salary pool to separate activities and cost drivers is essentially
impossible. There is no easy way for determining how much of the faculty salary pool
is due to: (1) the generation of student credit hours, and (2) the level of academic degrees
offered by academic unit.
<dd>The methodology explained and illustrated in this chapter allows for the inclusion. multiple cost drivers in</dd>
of multiple cost drivers in determining performance efficiency measures. The allocation
of the combined cost pool to individual activities might be regarded as not objectively
possible, impractical, expensive, or of insufficient additional value for the costing
system. We first consider the problem of estimating average costs per unit of cost driver
in such situations when cross-sectional data are available for a set of what we call
comparable business units. We also consider application of the same techniques to
basic cost models having marginal cost assessment capability, and briefly discuss the
setting in which a single business unit is observed over several time periods.
<dd>We define benchmark or best practice average costs per unit of cost driver as the cost rates associated with</dd>
average cost rates associated with the most efficient unit(s). A principle of maximum
performance efficiency (MPE) is proposed and estimation criteria based on efficiency
measures are derived from this principle. This is a generalization of the maximum
decisional efficiency (MDE) principle introduced in Troutt (1995) and also discussed in
Troutt (1997) and Troutt, Zhang, Tadisina, and Rai (1997). The efficiency measure used
may be considered analogous to the cost of unused capacity concept proposed by
Cooper and Kaplan (1992). These models also provide a different view on the lack of
proportionality of costs to driver levels documented in Noreen and Soderstrom (1994).
<dd>A basic assumption underlying the estimation principle employed here is that all from public service entities that are presumed</dd>
business units under comparison seek to maximize their efficiencies in performing their
services. The data we study are from public service entities that are presumed to have
this goal on behalf of the public interest. However, this assumption needs verification
as a kind of model aptness or validation issue similar to the requirement of normally
distributed errors in OLS regression. As an estimation model aptness test, we propose
what may be called a normal-like-or-better performance effectiveness measure. The
estimation models proposed here are linear programming (LP) models. Use of such
models in cost accounting is not new. See for example, Demski (1967), Itami and Kaplan
(1980), Kaplan and Thompson (1971), and Onsi (1970). These previous works have
generally utilized LP models assuming that data are known. That is, they assume that
technological coefficients and resource levels are given. Then the dual optimal solution
(especially the shadow prices) of these fully specified LP models has been employed for
(1) overhead allocation (Kaplan & Thompson, 1971), (2) transfer pricing (Onsi, 1970), and
(3) reallocation of costs to multiple products (Itami & Kaplan, 1980). However, the use
of LP models enters in a different way in this chapter. Namely, the estimation models are
themselves LP problems in which the decision variables are the unknown best practice
cost rates. The next section distinguishes between basic cost models and the models
used to estimate the parameters of the basic cost models. The MPE principle is also
presented here</p><br>

     <h1 style="font-size: 40px;"><b>BASIC COST MODELS AND ESTIMATION
MODELS</b></h1>
    <p><dd>There are two uses of the word “model” in this chapter. By the basic cost model, we between the cost driver</dd>
mean the assumed relationship between the cost driver of an activity and its contribution to
the total cost pool. The simplest case is that of proportional variation. Let yr be the amount
of the r-th cost driver. Under the basic cost model, the contribution to the total cost pool will
be ar
yr
, where ar
 may be called the average cost per unit of yr
 or simply the cost rate. This
chapter focuses on this basic cost model. Some other models such as for estimating marginal
costs are discussed briefly. The other use of the word “model” refers to the method used
to solve for estimates of the basic cost model parameters — the a*r
. The estimation models
used here are LP models. As noted above, this usage of LP does not appear to be similar to
previous uses in the accounting literature, but is a consequence of the estimation principle
used.
<dd>Suppose there are r=1…Rr
 activities with associated cost driver quantities of yr,
respectively. Then,</dd> as in Cooper and Kaplan (1992), the cost of resources consumed is given
by ∑ ar
 yr
. If x is the actual total cost pool associated with these activities, the cost of resources
supplied, then there may be a difference, s ≥ 0, such that<br><br>
<dd>∑ ar yr+ s = x.</dd><br> (2.1)
Cooper and Kaplan (1992) call s the cost of unused capacity. In their analysis, the x value was
a budget figure and the yr
 could vary due to decreased demands. We start from the same
construct but regard variations of the yr
 and x as due to more or less efficiency. By defining
what may be called best practice ar
 values, we therefore associate the s value with possible
inefficiency of a business unit, a cost of inefficiency.
<dd>Thus suppose we have j = 1…N comparable business units, achieving yrj units of
driver r, respectively, and with associated cost</dd>
. In addition to having the same
activities and cost drivers, we further require that comparable units be similar in the sense
that the practices, policies, technologies, employee competence levels, and managerial
actions of any one should be transferable, in principle, to any other. Define ar
* as the vector
of cost rates associated with the most efficient unit or units under comparison. Then in the
equation<br><br>∑=R r 1 ar *yrj + sj = xj for all j<br><br>the cost of unused capacity, sj
, may be interpreted as an inefficiency suffered by a failure to
achieve larger yrj values, smaller xj value, or some combination of these. The ratio vj
 =∑ ar
*yrj
/ xj , is an efficiency measure for the j-th unit when the ar
* are the true benchmark cost rates
and ∑ ar
*yrj≤ xj
 holds for all units. A technique for estimating parameters in efficiency ratios
of the above form was proposed in Troutt (1995). In that paper, the primary data were specific
decisions. Here a more general form of that approach called maximum performance efficiency
(MPE) is proposed and applied to estimate the benchmark ar
* values. Assume that each unit
j = 1…N, seeks to achieve maximum (1.0) efficiency. Then the whole set of units may b</p>

        <p>regarded as attempting to maximize the sum of these efficiency ratios, namely, ∑∑ar
*yrj / xj
.
The maximum performance efficiency estimation principle proposes estimates of the ar

those which render the total, or equivalently the average, of these efficiencies a maximum</p>

general utility of the approach than was indicated by the earlier MDE term. Managerial
performance, such as in the units under study here, involves many kinds, levels, and

cost rates, the ar

is proposed in a later section. As a linear programming problem, the MPE model is readily
solved by a wide variety of commonly available software products. MPE may be seen here
to be an estimation criterion analogous to the ordinary least squares error criterion in
regression. The cost model, ∑ ar
 Yrj is analogous to the regression model</p>

This last one was included as a cost driver (called an output by Dyson and Thanassoulis,

this for several reasons. First, these costs represented the cost of real resources used and
available for management deployment. Next, they felt that the increased number of variables
that would result might tend to decrease the discrimination power of the data envelopment
analysis (DEA) method they were studying. Next, and importantly, it was felt that the
disaggregated data were less reliable. This concern is well founded, particularly in the present
context. Datar and Gupta (1994) have shown that disaggregation can actually increase errors.
<dd>The method used in both Dyson and Thanassoulis (1988) and Thanassoulis et al (1987) of data envelopment analysis (DEA),</dd>
was a modification of data envelopment analysis (DEA), another efficiency estimation

        <p>points. An introduction to DEA is contained in Charnes, Cooper, Lewin, and Seiford. (1994).
There are several DEA models, but we limit our coverage to that used in Dyson and
Thanassoulis. If we use the ar
 notation for output weights in the DEA model M1 of Dyson
and Thanassoulis (page 564), we obtain the model(s):</p><br>

        <p><dd>Unlike the one-pass solution of model MPE, Model M1(jo

),
in turn. The solutions arjo therefore depend on which unit is being featured in the objective
function. Typically, some of the arjo values will be zero for various units. In the present cost
rates context, the following interpretation can be given to the M1(jo
) DEA model. If unit jo
were allowed to choose the activities and drivers to become applicable for the entire group
of units, then the M1(jo
) model solution obtains these in such a way as to give that unit the
most favorable efficiency score. The principal difficulty here is that no consensus is being
achieved on the most efficient cost rates. With the M1 (jo
) DEA model, each unit can select
cost rates that make it look most favorable. Dyson and Thanassoulis (1988) call this
phenomenon weights flexibility. Their work was motivated, in part, to modify the M1(jo
) DEA
technique to limit this flexibility, and provides a more extensive discussion of this DEA
limitation.
<dd>Except in unusual circumstances, activity cost rates, ar
, can only be positive. In this requirement as</dd>
section, we consider this requirement as a preemptive priority. For the solution values, ar
*,
to be strictly positive, it is necessary that they be basic variables in an optimal solution. This
may occur gratuitously. Otherwise one or more may be non-basic, and therefore have value
zero. The standard LP solution report provides reduced costs. For a variable with optimal
value of zero, the reduced cost may be interpreted as follows. It indicates the smallest amount
by which the objective function coefficient for the variable must be increased in order that
the variable becomes positive in an optimal solution.
<dd>The last column of Table 1 gives the efficiency scores obtained by model MPE with positive costs. Descriptive statistics</dd>
preemptive positive costs. Descriptive statistics have been added as supplemental information.
The MPE model was solved using SAS/IML software (1995), which includes a linear
programming call function. The initial solution assigned a zero optimal value only to a1
*. (The
full solution for this case was a1
*=0, a2
*=0.0882, a3
*=0.2671, a4
*=0.0664.) Thus, it was deemed
necessary to implement the preemptive positive weights modification. The reduced cost for
variable a1
 was given as -1.220440. The objective coefficient was 55.52898. Therefore, the
modified procedure required increasing the coefficient of a1
 to 56.747. The resulting estimates
were as follows</p><br><br>

<dd>While not true for the example presented here, it is possible that more than one cost initially estimated as zero or the </dd>
rate is initially estimated as zero or the reduced cost is also zero when strict positivity is
required. Then, it is necessary to proceed as follows. Suppose an auxiliary variable m, and
nr
 new constraints ar ≥ m are joined to the MPE model. If the optimal value of m is positive,
then so it must be also for all the cost rates. Let λ be a non-negative parameter chosen by the
analyst and consider the modified objective function given by</p><br>
        <p style="font-size: 30px;">max ∑ ∑ j r ar yrj + λ m</p>
        <p>When the value of λ is zero, the objective function is the same as the original one with m*

Theorem 1: Let z *(λ), ar

<dd>We propose the solution for positive weights to be that corresponding to the greatest This may be estimated by trial</dd>
lower bound of λ values for which m*(λ) > 0. This may be estimated by trial and error. We
develop a rationale for such positive weights procedures by writing the MPE model objective
function in the form ∑ar
 (∑ Yrj). If maximization of this objective function yields a1
* = 0, then
evidently the coefficient, ∑ Y1j is too small in some sense relative to the other coefficients.
It may be noted that the Yrj = yrj/xj
 data are in the nature of reciprocal costs. When the sum
of these is too small, the implication is that their own reciprocals, the xj
/yrj, are on average</p>

        <p>too large. This is suggestive of inefficiency with respect to the r-th activity. In such a case,
assignment of a zero optimal cost estimate would mask this kind of inefficiency. By using
the reduced cost adjustment, or adding the λm term to the objective function, a compensation
is made for coefficients that are apparently too small in that sense.
<dd>Some comparisons with the results of Dyson and Thanassoulis (1988) can now be
discussed. As part of their study, a regression</dd>origin was obtained. The
coefficients of that regression model can be interpreted as average cost rates for these
activities. The results were as follows:</p>
        <img src="WhatsApp%20Image%202024-02-06%20at%207.42.22%20PM.jpeg"><br>
        <p><dd>It will be noted that these average rates are uniformly higher than the presently giving a measure of face validity.</dd>
estimated rates in (3.4), giving a measure of face validity. That is, it is necessary that the cost
rates of the most efficient units be lower than the average cost rates for all the units. Also,
the four departments rated as most efficient by the present method are the same as those
indicated by the Dyson and Thanassoulis (1988) approach.
<dd>xIt may be observed that the preliminary regression step also gives information on the</dd><br>
question of positivity of the cost rates. The positivity of a1 gives further evidence on that
for a1<br><br>
*. Here a1 is positive and significant. (The significance level was not specified in Dyson
and Thanassoulis). Since the units are assumed to be comparable, it appears unlikely that
one or a few could perform activity one with no cost while the typical unit does incur cost
for the activity. If a particular unit could produce an activity with zero cost (ar
*= 0) while the
average unit does incur cost for the activity, then it must have a radically superior process
not actually comparable with the others. Similarly, this regression model also validates
activity four as influential on costs. The next section discusses model aptness</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 30px;"><b>ESTIMATION CRITERION QUALITY ISSUES</b></h2>
        <p><dd>A basic assumption underlying the MPE estimation principle’s applicability is that the
sample of units under analysis does,</dd> in fact, have the goal of achieving maximum (1.0)
efficiency. This is a model aptness issue that parallels the requirement of N(0,σ2
) residuals
in OLS regression theory. In the present MPE case, the corresponding issue is to specify
a measured characteristic of the vj
 that indicates consistency with a goal or target of unity
(1.0) efficiency. In this section, we propose what may be called the normal-like-or-better
effectiveness criterion for these fitted efficiency scores.
<dd>As a model for appropriate concentration on a target, we begin with an interpretation  normal distribution,</dd><br>
of the multivariate normal distribution, N (µ,Σ), on n ℜ . If a distribution of attempts has the
N(µ,Σ) or even higher concentration of density at the mode µ, then we propose this as
evidence that µ is indeed a plausible target of the attempts. This is exemplified by considering
a distribution model for the results of throwing darts at a bull’s-eye target. Common
experience suggests that a bivariate normal density represents such data reasonably well.
Steeper or flatter densities would still be indicative of effective attempts, but densities whose</p>

        <p>modes do not coincide with the target would cause doubts about whether the attempts have
been effective or whether another target better explains the data. We call this normal-like-orbetter (NLOB) performance effectiveness. It is next necessary to obtain the analog of this
criterion for the efficiency performance data Yrj relevant to the present context.
<dd>If x is distributed as N (µ,Σ) on n ℜ n, then it well known that the quadratic form, w(x)=
(x-µ)’Σ−1(x-µ) is gamma(α,β),</dd> where α = n/2 and β=2. This distribution is also called the Chisquare distribution with n degrees of freedom (see Law & Kelton, 1982). We may note that
for this case w(x) is in the nature of a squared distance from the target set {µ}. It is useful
to derive this result by a different technique. Vertical density representation (VDR) is a
technique for representing a multivariate density by way of a univariate density called the
ordinate or vertical density, and uniform distributions over the equidensity contours of the
original multivariate density. VDR was introduced in Troutt (1993). (See also Kotz, Fang &
Liang, 1997; Kotz & Troutt, 1996; Troutt ,1991; and Troutt & Pang, 1996.) The version of VDR
needed for the present purpose can be derived as follows. Let w(x) be a continuous convex
function on n ℜ with range [0,∞); and let g(w) be a density on [0,∞). Suppose that for each
value of u≥0, x is uniformly distributed on the set {x:w(x)=u}. Consider the process of sampling
a value of u according to the g(w) density, and then sampling a vector, x, according to the
uniform distribution on the set {x:w(x)=u}. Next let f(x) be the density of the resulting x variates
on n ℜ . Finally, let A(u) be the volume (Lebesgue measure) of the set {x : w(x) ≤ u}. Then<br><br>
we have the following VDR theorem that relates g(w) and f(x) in n ℜ . The proof is given in the Appendix.</p><br>
        <p style="font-size: 25px;">f(x) = φ(w(x)) and g(w) = φ(w) / A’(w)</p><br>
        <p>Theorem 2 can be applied to derive a very general density class for performance related to
squared distance type error measures. The set {x: (x-µ)’ Σ−1 (x-µ)≤ u} has volume, A(u), given
by A(u) = αn |Σ|1/2 u n/2 where αn
 = πn/2 / n
/
2 Γ(n
/
2
), (Fleming, 1977), so that A/
(u) = n

2 αn |Σ|1/

 u n/2 - 1 . The gamma(α,β) density is given b</p>
        <p style="font-size: 23px;">g(u) = (Γ(α)βα)-1 uα-1 exp{- u2 /β}.</p><br>
        <p>Therefore Theorem 2 implies that if w(x) = (x-µ) / Σ−1(x-µ) and g(u) = gamma (α,β), then the
corresponding f(x), which we now rename as ψ (x) = ψ (x;n,a,β), is given by</p>
        <p style="font-size: 28px;">ψ(x)= Γ( n / 2 )(πn/2Γ(α)βα) -1[(x-µ) ′ Σ-1(x-µ)] α-n/2 exp{- 1 / β
 (x-µ)’Σ-1(x-µ)} </p><br>
        <p>For this density class we have the following observations:
(1) If α = n/2 and β=2, then ψ(x) is the multivariate normal density, N(µ,Σ).
(2) If α = n/2 and β ≠ 2, then ψ(x) is steeper or flatter than N(µ,Σ) according to whether β
<dd> 2 or β>2, respectively. We call these densities the normal-like densities</dd>
</p>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 15px;">Copyright © 2003, Idea Group Inc. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written

        <p>(3) If α  then ψ(x) is unbounded at its mode, µ, but may be more or less steep according
 <dd>to the value of β. We call this class the better-than-normal-like density class.</dd>
(4) If α > n/2, then ψ(x) has zero density at the target, µ, and low values throughout
neighborhoods of µ. This suggests that attempts at the target are not effective. The
data may have arisen in pursuit of a different target or simply not be effective for any
target</p><br>
        <p>For densities in Category (3), the unbounded mode concentrates more probability near
the target and suggests a higher level of expertise than that evidenced by the finite-at-mode
N(µ,Σ) class. It seems reasonable to refer to α in this context as the expertise, mode, or target
effectiveness parameter, while β is a scale or precision parameter. Thus, if α ≤ n/2, we call
ψ(x) the normal-like-or-better performance density. To summarize, if attempts at a target set
in n ℜ have a basic squared distance error measure and this measure is distributed with the
gamma(α,β) density with α≤n
/
2, then the performance with respect to this target set is normallike-or-better (NLOB).
<dd>We extend this target effectiveness criterion to the present context as follows. The
target set is {Y∈ 4 ℜ : Σar 
Yr</dd>
=1, Yr ≥ 0 for all r}. If Σar
Yrj = vj, then the distance of Yrj from the
target set is (1-v) Q%aQ%-1. Since 0 ≤ v ≤ 1, we employ the transformation w =(-ln v)2
 = (ln
v )2
. This transformation has the properties that w ≅ (1-v)2
 near v=1 and w∈[0,∞). Therefore,
w/Q%aQ%2
 = (ln v)2
/Q%aQ%2
 is an approximate squared distance measure near the target set.
Since the Q%aQ%2 term is a scale factor, it can be absorbed into the β parameter of gamma(α,β).
We therefore consider the NLOB effectiveness criterion to hold if w has the gamma(α,β)
density with α ≤ 4
/
2
=2. That is, such performance is analogous to that of unbiased normallike-or-better distributed attempts at a target in n ℜ . There is one additional consideration
before applying this effectiveness criterion to the present data. In the LP estimation model
MPE, at least one efficiency, vj
, must be unity (and hence wj
 = 0). This is because at least
one constraint (2.6) must be active in an optimal solution of the MPE model. We therefore
consider the model for the wj
 to b</p>
        <p style="font-size: 24px;">p δ(0) + (1-p) gamma(α,β),</p><br><br>
        <p>where p is the frequency of zero values (here p = 3/62 = 0.048 from Table 1), and δ(0) is the
degenerate density concentrated at w = 0. We call this the gamma-plus-zero density,
gamma(α,β)+0 . For this data, we regard the NLOB criterion to hold if it holds for the gamma
density in (4.2). When the gamma(α,β) density is fitted to the strictly positive w values,
then NLOB requires that α ≤ 2. For the data of wj
 = (ln vj
)
2 based on Table 1, Column 7, the
parameter value estimates obtained by the Method of Moments (see, for example, Bickell &
Doksum, 1977) are α = 1.07 and β = 0.32. This method was chosen because the BESTFIT
software experienced difficulty in convergence using its default Maximum Likelihood
Estimation procedure. The Method of Moments estimates parameters by setting theoretical<br>
moments equal to sample moments. For the gamma(α,β) density, µ = αβ, and σ2 = αβ2
. If w<br>
and s2
 are the sample mean and variance of the positive wj
 values, then the α and β estimates
are given by</p>

        <p style="font-size: 25px;">αˆ = w 2 /s2 and β ˆ = s2 / w .</p><br><br>
        <p>Tests of fit of the wj
 data to the gamma (α = 1.07, β = 0.32) density were carried out using the
software BestFit  (1995). All three tests provided in BestFit —the Chi-square, KolmogorovSmirnov, and the Anderson-Darling— indicated acceptance of the gamma model with
confidence levels greater than 0.95. In addition, for each of these tests, the gamma model was
judged best fitting (rank one) among the densities in the library of BestFit . We therefore
conclude that the NLOB condition is met. Use of the NLOB criterion in this way may be
regarded as somewhat stringent in that the zero data are only used to define the target and
are not used to assess NLOB target effectiveness.
<dd>The NLOB criterion is important in establishing whether the estimated cost model is a plausible goal</dd> of the units being studied. The MPE model will produce estimates for any
arbitrary set of Yrj data. However, if the resulting vj
 data were, for example, uniformly
distributed on [0,1], there would be little confidence in the estimated model</p><br><br>
        <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 30px;"><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h2>
        <p><dd>Limitations may be discussed for both the new estimation technique itself and for its application to the</dd> present context and data. In order to more fully parallel existing OLS theory
for model aptness testing, attention should be given to potential outliers, independence of
the vj
, and constancy of the distribution of the vj
 from trial to trial (analogous to homoscedasticity
in OLS theory; see, for example, Madansky, 1988, and Neter, Wasserman & Kutner, 1985).
Theory developments for these issues are not yet available for the MPE model.
<dd>Hypothesis tests and confidence intervals for the estimates do not appear to be readily derivable from the proposed</dd> approach. However, information on their variances can be
obtained by simulation using additional specific assumptions. As an illustration, 100 data
sets of 62 observations each were simulated as follows. A value of vj was generated using
the density model (4.2) and the estimates of p, α, and β. Then a vector, Yrj, was generated<br>
according to the uniform distribution on the convex polytope {Y:∑r ar
*Yr
 = vj
, Yr 
        ≥ 0}where<br><br>
ar
* is given by (3.4). Then the MPE model, (2.3)—(2.5) was solved for each data set and
descriptive statistics for the estimates were obtained. Additional details on the simulation
steps are given in the Appendix. The results are shown in Table 3</p>
        <p><i>Table 3: Descriptive statistics estimated from 100 simulated data sets</i></p>

        <p><dd>The proposed NLOB criterion is a strong standard for performance effectiveness. It requires that squared</dd> distance performance with respect to the target set be as good or better
than that of unbiased multivariate normal-like performance with respect of a point target in<br> ℜ . A still weaker class of target effectiveness densities might be developed in further
research by inclusion of a vector parameter corresponding to possible bias in the multivariate
normal-like model.
<dd>xWith regard to limitations of the methodology for the application setting and data used here, we discuss first the cost of unused</dd> capacity connection again. A cost of unused
capacity in the Cooper and Kaplan (1992) sense, which can be denoted as sj
ck, might coexist
along with a cost of inefficiency, sj
I, as used in the present chapter; so that sj
 = sj
ck + sj
I
. The
effect of such unused capacities, as distinct from costs of inefficiencies, on the present results
would be to understate the true efficiencies. The approach taken with the MPE model is worstcase in the sense that when the sj
ck are identifiable, the appropriate data adjustment would
be xj
’= xj
 - sj
ck and the average performance efficiency would be expected to be larger.
Thanassoulis et al. (1987) also discuss what we have called comparability of these units. A
concern was noted relative to activity four whose monetary driver level might have been
affected by the prosperity of the community being served. That is, offices with above average
community prosperity and corresponding activity four levels might be considered as being
unfairly compared to the others. Other things being equal, units with an inappropriately
inflated value of a driver level would be expected to exert heavy downward pressure on the
corresponding estimate in model MPE. We believe this kind of incomparability should ideally
be removed by some kind of normalization process such as division by a socio-economic
index. For the sake of concentrating on essential features of the present technique and
maintaining comparability with the results of Dyson and Thanassoulis (1988), we leave this
level of detailed analysis beyond the scope of the chapter.
<dd>In the use of the NLOB criterion for this data, the α parameter was compared to n/2 when n=4 was chosen. This assumes</dd> that the Yr
 data are truly four-dimensional. The discussion
of the data in Thanassoulis et al. (1987) suggested to us that units were free to emphasize or
vary all four drivers with the possible exception of the fourth one. If this driver is regarded
as not available for improvement by the units, then the data should be considered as threedimensional. In this case, the intended α would be compared with 1.5. Since αˆ =1.07, the<br>
NLOB criterion is still met by the data under this assumption</p><br><br>
        <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 30px;"><b>EXTENSIONS TO OTHER BASIC COST MODELS</b></h2>
        <p><dd>This section discusses extensions to the three cases: (1) time-series data,(2) marginal
cost-oriented basic cost models, and</dd> (3) single driver-single cost pool data.</p><br><br>
        <h3 style="font-size: 30px;">Time-Series Data</h3>
        <p><dd>Suppose the data Yrt are given over time periods indexed by t for a single business unit. Then the MPE model with index</dd>j replaced by t can be applied. First, it would be necessary</p><br>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 15px;">Copyright © 2003, Idea Group Inc. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written
permission of Idea Group Inc. is prohibited</p><br><br>
        <p>to adjust all the xt
 cost-pool figures and resulting Yrt data to reflect current dollars using a cost
index. This assumes that the estimated ar
* cost rates are in terms of current dollars. Next,
these rates would be interpretable as follows. The estimated ar
* in the current dollar timeseries case may be interpreted to be the cost rate vector achieved by the unit during its most
efficient observation period or periods. The resulting vt
 suggest periods of more or less
efficiency, and would be a useful source for self-study aimed at productivity and process
improvements.
<dd>The comparability issue for the units under comparison should be easier to accept in this case. However, process or technology</dd> changes during the data time span could be
problematical. A more complete discussion of limitations for this case is left for specific future
applications.
<dd>In addition to the NLOB effectiveness test, additional considerations can be brought to bear with respect to an improvement</dd> over time dimension. Effectiveness in this respect
would be supported by establishing a significant fit of the vt
 data to a monotone increasing
function of time, for example, the reciprocal of a learning curve. Over longer periods of times,
learning curve patterns for the estimated gamma parameters could serve similarly. That is,
decreasing α indicates improving target effectiveness, while decreasing β would indicate
improving precision.</p><br><br>
        <h2><b>Marginal Cost-Oriented Basic Cost Models</b></h2>
        <p><dd>Both the time-series and cross-sectional versions of the MPE model can be adapted to nonlinear basic cost models with marginal</dd>features. For example, consider the original
cross-sectional case, but using the basic cost model</p><br>
        <p style="font-size: 28px;">Σr ar yrj + Σr br yrj 2 +sj =xj</p><br><br>
        <p>Again s is interpreted as a possible inefficiency due to experiencing higher than benchmark
ar
 and/or br
 values. The cost of service provided by activity r is ar
* yr
 + br
* yr
2
 for efficient
units. By differentiation, the marginal cost by this model for activity r becomes ar
* + 2br
*yr
at the observed driver level. Defining new data elements Yrj
(2) =y2
rj/xj , the modified MPE
model becomes</p><br><br>
        <img src="WhatsApp%20Image%202024-02-06%20at%208.41.30%20PM.jpeg"><br><br>
        <p>The constraints (6.4) ensure that cost contributions can only be non-negative, even if some
br
 is negative. In that case, the marginal rate is decreasing; if these coefficients are positive,
the corresponding marginal rates are increasing. Here a quadratic basic cost model was used.
More generally, other models with different marginal cost structures could be employed (e.g.,
Cobb-Douglas as in Noreen and Soderstrom, 1994).

        <h3 style="font-size: 35px;">Implications for the Single Driver Single Cost Pool Case</h3>
        <p><dd>The MPE model for this case simplifies to max ∑ a Yj , s.t. a Yj ≤ 1, for all j, and a ≥ 0. The solution this model</dd>of this model is clearly a* = min Yj
-1 = min xj
/yj
. The NLOB criterion requires α* ≤
½ in this case. If this condition fails to hold, then this minimum value may be unreasonably
low, perhaps due to an outlier. Deletion of one or a few such tentative outliers would be well
supported if the remaining data do, in fact, pass the NLOB test. Otherwise no credible ar
estimate is forthcoming from the present method. It should be noted that the simulation
method could also be employed for this case, provided the NLOB criterion is met.</p><br><br>
        <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 40px;"><b>DATA-MINING APPLICATIONS AND
CONSIDERATIONS</b></h2>
        <p><dd>Benchmark estimation models, such as those considered here, may also be called frontier regression models. The general</dd> application of these in data mining has been
discussed in Troutt, Hu, Shanker, and Acar (2001). They are formed to explain boundary,
frontier or optimal behavior rather than average behavior as, for example, in ordinary
regression models. Such a model may also be called a ceiling model if it lays above all the
observations or a floor model in the opposite case. The cost-estimation model of this chapter
is a floor model since it predicts the best, i.e., lowest, cost units.
<dd>The model considered here is a cross-sectional one. Although data mining is ordinarily thought of from the perspective of mining</dd>data from within a single organization, benchmarking
type studies must often involve comparisons of data across organizations. Benchmarking
partnerships have been formed for this purpose as discussed in Troutt, Gribbin, Shanker, and
Zhang (2000). Such benchmarking-oriented data mining might be extended in a number of
directions. Potential applications include comparisons of quality and other costs, processing
and set-up times, and employee turnover. More generally, benchmarking comparisons could
extend to virtually any measure of common interest across firms or other entities, such as
universities, states, and municipalities. In the example in this chapter, a simple cost model
was used to explain best practice performance. More generally, best practice performance
may depend on other explanatory variables or categories of interest to the firm. Discovery
of such models, variables, and categories might be regarded as the essence of data mining.
With techniques discussed here, the difference is the prediction of frontier rather than
average performance. For example, interest often centers on best instances such as customers
most responsive to mailings, safest drivers, etc.
<dd>However, cross-sectional applications of benchmark performance models do not
necessarily depend on the multiple firm situations. Mining</dd> across all a firm’s customers can
also be of interest. Consider a planned mail solicitation of a sales firm. For mailings of a given
type, it is desirable to predict the set of most responsive customers so that it can be targeted.
Similarly, a charitable organization may be interested in discovering how to characterize its
best or worst supporters according to a model.
<dd>xAs noted above, under the topic of time-series data, such frontier models can be used within a single organization where</dd> the benchmarking is done across time periods. Models
of this type might be used to mine for explanatory variables or conditions that account for</p>

        <p><dd>best or worst performance periods. Some of the same subjects as noted above for crosssectional studies may</dd> be worthwhile targets. For example, it would be of interest for quality
assurance to determine the correlates of best and worst defect production rates.
<dd>Ordinary regression is one of the most important tools for data mining. Frontier models, such as considered here,</dd> may be desirable alternatives in connection with data-mining
applications. This is especially the case when it is desired to characterize and model the best
and/or worst cases in the data. Such data are typically of the managed kind. In general, such
managed data or data from purposeful or goal-directed behavior will be amenable to frontier
modeling</p>
        <h2 style="font-size: 40px; text-align: center;"><b>CONCLUSIONS</b></h2>
        <p><dd>This chapter proposes a method for estimating what may be called benchmark, or best the MDE principle units being compared</dd> practice unit and marginal cost rates. These rates provide plausible operational
goals for the management of the units being compared. This method also provides
efficiency measures and suggests which organizational units or time periods are more or
less efficient, as well as an estimate of the degree of such inefficiency. Efficient units or
time periods provide benchmarks for imitation by other units or can be studied for
continuous improvement possibilities. As far as the authors can determine, the proposed
methodology is the first technique with the capability to suggest plausible benchmark
cost rates.
<dd>A principle of maximum performance efficiency (MPE) was proposed as a generalization of the maximum decisional efficiency</dd> principle in Troutt (1995). This
principle is more broadly applicable than the MDE principle. Also, a gamma distributionbased validation criterion was proposed for the new MPE principle. The earlier MDE
principle appealed to the maximum likelihood estimation principle for model aptness
validation, but required relatively inflexible density models for the fitted efficiency
scores.
<dd>The estimation models derived here reduce to straightforward linear programming models and are therefore</dd> widely accessible. A case was made that an optimal cost rate
estimate of zero for some activity may be indicative of generally poor efficiency across
the units with respect to one or more activities. Modifications based on reduced costs
and augmented objective functions were proposed to compensate in that case.
<dd>In these models, the unknown cost rate parameters resemble the coefficients of
linear regression models. However, the maximum performance</dd> efficiency estimation
principle is employed rather than a criterion such as ordinary least squares. This principle
assumes that for each organizational unit and time period, the unit intends to minimize
these costs. Model adequacy with respect to this assumption was judged by a test of
normal-like-or-better performance effectiveness for the estimated efficiency scores.
<dd>These results are also consistent with Noreen and Soderstrom (1994) who found
that costs were not generally proportional to</dd>levels in a cross-sectional study
of hospital accounts. The results of this chapter suggest that one source of such nonproportionality, in addition to the possibly non-linear form of the basic cost model, is
what we call performance inefficiency.</p><br><br>

        <p><dd>The proposed estimation criterion was applied to a published data set previously analyzed by a modified data envelopment</dd> method. The resulting estimates were
compared with the average costs obtained by the previous method. The estimated
benchmark cost rates were uniformly and strictly lower than their average rate counterparts, consistent with their definitions and providing a strong measure of face validity.
<dd>Benchmarking estimation models, such as discussed here, provide a new tool for
data mining when the emphasis is on modeling </dd>the best performers</p><br><br>
